### Purpose
For me to experiement and learn about the structure of a coding language

### Expectations
For me to be able to create a few functions that will work within the scope of this project
Look into compiling it using LLVM
To use syntax from go, python, SQL

### Examples
---------Trying to get----------
create func_name<int x, int y> out int z:
  return x + y
;

### Bool type stuff from SQL
return A AND B
return A OR B

### Future expectations
Something for me to mess around with


### Current understanding
- Scope
- AST tree
- Lexer
- Parser
- Visitor

### Current issues
- Infinite loop I need to track down
- Change the example syntax to what I have in mind
